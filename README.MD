### Light-weight scalable Discord bot
Bot is written using JDA library and common sense.
#### Credits
- [JDA](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/releases) for flexible and intuitive Discord API Java wrapper
- [Yui-bot](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/Yui) for basic idea of how discord bot should work
#### ToDo List
1. Add [JDA-Utilities](https://github.com/JDA-Applications/JDA-Utilities) to use compact menus for bot's response
2. Add Music Player:
* [LavaPlayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer) that is fully compatible with JDA
* [implementation](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer#usage) in the bot
* [demo](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer/tree/master/demo-jda) that has full implementation
* [JMusic](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot) for fully functional music bot with menus, etc
